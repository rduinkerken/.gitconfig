# My .gitconfig

This repository contains my git configurations.

These configuration will help me be more efficient executing git commands.

Feel free to use it and become more lazy! =)


# Commands
## `git statusnum`
  - Performs the cheeky `git status` but adds a number in front of the file.
  - Other commands can interact with this file number.
